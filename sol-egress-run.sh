# Sol runner WITH EGRESS — approved by jes 2026-08-07 ("i approve your egress plan").
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: jes ruled Sol may have internet access. Measurement showed the real
# cost was never the network boolean alone -- it is the boolean COMPOSED WITH BROAD READS.
# Inside a plain `--sandbox workspace-write` run, Sol could read ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and saw
# LETTA_API_KEY + SQUAD_ALERTS_PUBLISHER_TOKEN in its environment. With egress open, that
# combination is the whole exfiltration surface.
#
# codex's own shell_environment_policy DOES NOT scrub those vars -- measured, three variants
# (inherit="core", exclude globs, exclude exact names) all still showed 2. Cause unknown.
# So the scrub happens HERE, in the parent env, where it is verifiable by effect.
#
# What this does NOT change: the live store and the CLI escript stay unreachable. This
# wrapper only removes secrets and grants network; it never widens write access.
